1. Complete exercise-5-6, i.e implement other functions using pointers - I have only implemented getline using pointers.
2. Exercise-5-7 - This program is about sorting strings using quick sort, which I have not understood - Revisit this problem after learning quicksort.
3. Exercise-5-11, Exercise-5-12 - Not done as I have not done the entab and detab from exercise 1
