/*
 * My algorithm to fold lines as specified by the given fold width.
 * Create a character array (buffer) of the required fold width + 1 (for the
 * null char) Set rem = 0 While EOF is not yet reached. Read upto a newline or
 * fold width - rem characters, whichever is smaller into the buffer If the
 * number of characters read are less than fold width Print buffer Else Find the
 * index of the last space, hyphen or tab from the buffer. If no such position
 * was found Set index to fold width - 1
 *
 *          Print buffer until this index (not inclusive)
 *          Print a newline
 *
 *          Set rem to the number of remaining characters.
 *          Print remaining characters of the buffer.
 *  ^^^
 *  For some reason, the above algorithm does not work correctly.
 *
 *  New and improvised algorithm
 *  =============================
 *  Set used_space = 0
 *  While EOF is not yet reached
 *      Read (FOLD_WIDTH - used_space) characters from the input or till a
 * newline, whichever is smaller into buffer. If the last character of the
 * buffer(string) is a newline Print the buffer Set used_space = 0 Else Find the
 * index of the last space, tab or hyphen (break character) from then end. If no
 * space was found Print the buffer completely Print a newline Set used_space =
 * 0 Else Print the buffer till the last break character (excluding the break
 * character). Print a newline Print characters after the last break character
 * till the end of the buffer. Set used_space = Number of characters after the
 * last break character.
