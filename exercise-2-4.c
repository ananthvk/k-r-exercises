/** Exercise 2-4. Write an alternative version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in
  * s1 that matches any character in the string s2. */
/*
 * Simple algorithm
 * ===============
 * Time complexity : n^2 (m*n if the length of the strings are different)
 * j = 0
 * For every character c of s1
 *      If c is not present in s2
 *          s1[j] = c
 *          Increment j by 1
 * Set the value of s1[j] to null character.
 *
 * Improved algorithm
 * ==================
 * Time complexity : 2n (m + n if the length of the strings are different)
 * Currently works only for ASCII.
 * I am not using a map/hashmap here.
 * Create an array of size 256.(Larger if you want to support other charsets).
 * Call it charactermap and initialize it to 0.
 *
 * For every char c2 of s2
 *      Check if c2 is within range of the charactermap array.
 *      charactermap[c2] = 1
 *
 * j = 0
 * For every char c1 of s1
 *      If charactermap[c1] == 0 then
 *          s1[j] = c1
 *          Increment j by 1
 * Set the value of s1[j] to null character.
