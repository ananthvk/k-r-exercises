/** Exercise 2-8. Write a function rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated
  * to the right by n positions */
/*
 * Example
 * ========
 * Let a = x x x x y y y
 * n = 3
 * y y y x x x x
 * n = 3
 * x x x y y y x
 * n = 1
 * x x x x y y y
 * n = 3
 * y y y x x x x
 *
 *
 * Algorithm
 * ============
 * Let x be the integer to be right rotated.
 * Let n be the number of positions to rotate.
 * temp = x >> n
 * Let len = 0
 *
 * [Find the number of significant bits in x]
 * [NOTE: Negative numbers cause an issue here]
 * while temp != 0
 *      temp = temp >> 1
 *      len = len + 1
 *
 * [mask to extract the contents which were right shifted]
 * mask = (1 << n) - 1
 * y = mask & x
 * result = (y << len) | (x >> n)
 *

/*
 * NOTE: This was my understanding of right rotate shift.
 * But according to various sources, you have to also shift the zeros according
 * to the datatype.
 * For example:
 * 0 0 0 x x x y y
 * Right rotate shift by 2 results in
 * y y 0 0 0 x x x
 * Instead of 
 *       y y x x x
